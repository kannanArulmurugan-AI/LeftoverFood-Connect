# RealTime Food Bargain

### Overview
This web application provides a platform for real-time interaction between hotels and people. The main concept is that hotels can sell extra food at low prices, and people can engage in real-time bidding for these meals. Once an order is prepaid, it is confirmed, and the food stock is updated in real time.

### Features
- **Hotel Owners:** Post available extra food with real-time price updates.
- **Customers:** View available food, place bids, and make prepayments to confirm orders.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Bids, stock levels, and orders are updated instantly using Firebase.
- **User Roles:** Different interfaces for hotel owners and customers, with Firebase authentication.
- **Secure Payments:** Integrated payment gateway for prepayment and order confirmation.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Firebase Authentication
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore, Firebase Functions, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data updates
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting
- **Payment Integration:** Stripe (optional for payments)

### Modules
1. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
2. **Hotel Owner Interface**: Post food items, manage stock, accept bids, real-time updates
3. **Customer Interface**: View food items, place bids, make prepayments
4. **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for bid and order updates
5. **Real-Time Database Updates**: Firebase Firestore for managing stock, bids, and orders

Firebase Configuration

This section will help new developers set up their Firebase project correctly.

markdown

### Firebase Configuration

To get the app running with Firebase:

1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. In the Firebase project settings, create a new web app and obtain the `firebaseConfig` credentials.
3. Download the credentials and paste them into the `src/firebaseConfig.js` file like so:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
};
export default firebaseConfig;

    Make sure you enable the following Firebase services:
        Authentication: Enable Email/Password or other providers.
        Firestore Database: Create collections like users, foodItems, orders, and bids.
        Cloud Functions: Implement server-side logic like notifications or stock updates.
        Cloud Messaging: Enable notifications for real-time updates.

    Run the app using:

    bash

    npm start

### API Endpoints (For Firebase Functions)

If you are using **Firebase Functions** for server-side logic like stock management or sending notifications, include a section detailing the API endpoints.

```markdown
### API Endpoints (Firebase Functions)

The app uses Firebase Functions to handle key backend operations. Below are some sample API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                                 |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/createOrder`         | Creates a new order when a customer pre-pays|
| GET    | `/getFoodItems`        | Fetches available food items                |
| POST   | `/acceptBid`           | Hotel owner accepts a bid from a customer   |

Make sure to deploy Firebase Functions after modifying the code:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions

python

Environment Variables

If your project uses environment variables (for Firebase keys, API endpoints, etc.), it’s helpful to explain how to set them up.

markdown

### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to store sensitive data like Firebase configuration and API keys. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_STRIPE_API_KEY=your-stripe-api-key (if you're using Stripe for payments)

Make sure to not commit the .env file to version control. You can add it to .gitignore:

bash

.env

Deployment

If you plan to deploy your app, a deployment section can guide users on how to get the application live. Here’s an example for deploying to Firebase Hosting.

markdown

### Deployment
