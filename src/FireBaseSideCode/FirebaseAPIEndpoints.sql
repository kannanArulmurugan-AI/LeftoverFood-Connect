|--------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/createOrder`         | Creates a new order when a customer pre-pays|
| GET    | `/getFoodItems`        | Fetches available food items                |
| POST   | `/acceptBid`           | Hotel owner accepts a bid from a customer   |
